    <p>A hike is a long, vigorous walk, usually on trails or footpaths in the countryside. Walking for pleasure
        developed in
        Europe during the eighteenth century.Long hikes as part of a religious pilgrimage have existed for a much longer
        time. "Hiking" is the preferred term in Canada and the United States; the term "walking" is used in these
        regions for
        shorter, particularly urban walks.
